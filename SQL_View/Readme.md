In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. Views allow you to abstract the complexity of your database schema and provide a simplified and secure way to access data. Here are some common types of views, along with their definitions and example code:

### 1. **Simple View:**
   - **Definition:** A basic view that selects columns from one or more tables.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW simple_view AS
    SELECT id, name FROM employees;
    ```

### 2. **Complex View:**
   - **Definition:** A view that involves joins, aggregations, or other complex operations.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW complex_view AS
    SELECT employees.id, employees.name, departments.department_name
    FROM employees
    JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
    ```

### 3. **Indexed View:**
   - **Definition:** A view that has an index, which can improve query performance.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW indexed_view WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id;

    CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_indexed_view ON indexed_view(department_id);
    ```

### 4. **Materialized View:**
   - **Definition:** A view that stores the result set physically and is periodically refreshed.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW materialized_view AS
    SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id;
    ```

### 5. **Partitioned View:**
   - **Definition:** A view that represents data from multiple tables through partitioning.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW partitioned_view AS
    SELECT * FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM table2;
    ```

### 6. **Updatable View:**
   - **Definition:** A view that allows modifications (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) directly through the view.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW updatable_view AS
    SELECT id, name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = 1
    WITH CHECK OPTION;
    ```

### 7. **Joined View:**
   - **Definition:** A view that combines columns from multiple tables through joins.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW joined_view AS
    SELECT employees.id, employees.name, departments.department_name
    FROM employees
    JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
    ```

### 8. **Encrypted View:**
   - **Definition:** A view that has encrypted columns for added security.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW encrypted_view AS
    SELECT id, ENCRYPT(name) AS encrypted_name
    FROM sensitive_data;
    ```

### 9. **Recursive View:**
   - **Definition:** A view that refers to itself, commonly used for hierarchical data.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW recursive_view AS
    SELECT employee_id, manager_id
    FROM employees
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.employee_id, r.manager_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN recursive_view r ON e.manager_id = r.employee_id;
    ```

### 10. **Indexed View with Filter:**
   - **Definition:** A view with an index and a WHERE clause to filter data.
   - **Example Code:**

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW filtered_view AS
    SELECT id, name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 50000;

    CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_filtered_view ON filtered_view(id);
    ```

These are examples of different types of views you might encounter in SQL. The code provided is simplified and may need adjustments based on your specific database schema and requirements.
