**Stored Procedure in SQL:**

### Definition:

A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. It's typically stored in a database and can be invoked by name. Stored procedures are supported by most relational database management systems (RDBMS), including MariaDB.

### Use Cases:

1. **Code Reusability:**
   - **Scenario:** Suppose you have a complex SQL query or a series of statements that you need to execute frequently. Instead of writing the same code each time, you can encapsulate it in a stored procedure.
   - **Example:** A stored procedure to calculate the total sales for a given product over a specific period.

2. **Enhanced Security:**
   - **Scenario:** Access to database objects can be controlled through stored procedures. Users can be granted permission to execute a stored procedure without needing direct access to the underlying tables.
   - **Example:** A stored procedure that retrieves sensitive employee information, but only authorized users are granted execution permission.

3. **Transaction Management:**
   - **Scenario:** You can wrap a series of SQL statements in a stored procedure and manage transactions more effectively. Transactions can be committed or rolled back within the procedure.
   - **Example:** A stored procedure for transferring funds between bank accounts, ensuring atomicity and consistency.

4. **Improved Performance:**
   - **Scenario:** Stored procedures are precompiled and optimized by the database engine. They can provide performance improvements compared to ad-hoc SQL queries.
   - **Example:** A stored procedure to retrieve aggregated data from large datasets with optimized execution plans.

5. **Reduced Network Traffic:**
   - **Scenario:** Instead of sending multiple SQL statements over the network, a client can call a stored procedure with a single request, reducing network latency.
   - **Example:** A stored procedure to fetch data needed for a report generation, reducing the amount of data transmitted between the application and the database server.

### Advantages:

1. **Encapsulation:**
   - Stored procedures encapsulate the implementation details, allowing developers to focus on the higher-level logic.

2. **Modularity:**
   - Procedures can be modularized, promoting a more structured and modular database design.

3. **Maintainability:**
   - Changes to business logic can be made in a single stored procedure, enhancing code maintainability.

4. **Performance:**
   - Precompiled stored procedures can provide better performance compared to ad-hoc SQL queries.

5. **Security:**
   - Access to data can be controlled through stored procedures, limiting direct access to tables.

6. **Transaction Control:**
   - Stored procedures can be used to manage transactions, ensuring data consistency.

In summary, stored procedures in SQL offer a range of benefits, including code reusability, enhanced security, improved performance, and better transaction management. They are a valuable tool for database developers and administrators.
